# COMP 373 - Facility of the Jollibee Food Chain
## What It Is
Project 2 for COMP 373. Building a Facility structure for the Jollibee Fast Food Chain.

## Summary
For this project, we created a Facility in which there are lots for shops in a food court that people can rent out. We used the specifications provided in class as the basis for all of our methods. We divided the project into different packages to organize the code. 
03/29/20 - We have now implemented beans to create the objects for the system.

### How to Run:
1. Open project in Eclipse or any Java IDE. 
2. Run as a Java application in order to view Facility Information.  

### How to Run Tests:
1. Open test files in the default package 
2. Select Run as JUnit Test to run the unit tests. 

## Specifications
System Name: Facility Management System

System Design: The facilities are the lots in a food court for different restaurants (e.g. Jollibee) located within a mall. The system will support the management of the different lots, their leases, and maintenance.
These are the three main functions of the system:

  1. Facility and its details - this describes functions such as the ability to add a new facility in the food court, or remove a facility in the food court.
  2. Facility use - this describes the acts of setting a facility to use, and determining the length of its usage.
  3. Facility maintenance - this describes the maintenance of a facility in order to keep it function. This includes scheduling maintenance, and specifying maintenance requests.
